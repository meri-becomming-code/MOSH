# 🎭 USER PERSONAS & TOOLKIT EVALUATION

## Purpose
Evaluate the MOSH ADA Toolkit from the perspective of 5 different target users to identify strengths, gaps, and improvements.

---

## PERSONA 1: Sarah Chen - Elementary School Teacher (K-5)

### Demographics
- **Age**: 32
- **Location**: Austin, TX
- **Experience**: 7 years teaching
- **Tech Level**: ⭐⭐ (Basic - uses Google Classroom, struggles with new software)
- **Subject**: 3rd Grade, All Subjects
- **School Type**: Public Elementary (Title I)

### Background
Sarah has 300+ images in her Canvas course from her reading units and science projects. She's terrified of the April 2026 deadline because she barely knows what "alt text" means. Her district sent an email saying "get your courses ADA compliant" but provided no training or tools. She's working on a teacher's salary and can't afford to pay for consultants.

### Goals
- Make her course compliant without spending money
- Not lose her entire spring break to manual work
- Understand what she's doing (not just click buttons blindly)
- Keep her job (worried about compliance failures)

---

### 📊 SARAH'S EVALUATION

#### **Landing Page (https://meri-becomming-code.github.io/mosh/)**

**First Impression (5 seconds):**
> "Oh good, it says K-12! And it's free! But... what's 'remediates'? Is that fixing? The design looks professional though, so maybe it's legit?"

**✅ What Works:**
- "Works for Elementary → University" - She sees herself here!
- "100% Free" - Huge relief
- "April 2026 Federal Deadline" - Creates urgency, she knows about this
- Professional design - Looks trustworthy
- "Made by a teacher" - She trusts other teachers

**❌ Pain Points:**
- Word "remediates" is confusing (too technical)
- Doesn't immediately show WHAT it does (screenshots would help)
- No testimonials from other elementary teachers
- Unclear if it's "too advanced" for her

**What She Needs:**
- "See it in action" - 30-second GIF or video preview
- Testimonial: "I'm a 2nd grade teacher and this was SO easy!"
- "No technical skills required" - explicitly stated
- Simple language: "Fixes your Canvas pages automatically"

---

#### **First-Time User Wizard**

**Opens toolkit, clicks "💡 First Time? Start Here!"**

> "Okay, this is PERFECT! It's literally step 1, 2, 3. And it says 'No API key needed' - I don't even know what that means but I'm glad I don't need it!"

**✅ What Works:**
- Three simple steps - she can follow this
- "Works for Elementary through high school" - reassuring
- "No coding or technical skills needed" - exactly what she needed to hear
- Q&A section answers her fear: "What if I mess up?"

**❌ Pain Points:**
- "Export course content from Canvas" - She's never done this before
- Needs a VIDEO walkthrough, not just text
- "imscc file" - what's that? Needs explanation

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add screenshots of each Canvas step
- Video link: "Watch how to export from Canvas (2 min)"
- Glossary tooltip: "imscc = Canvas course backup file"

---

#### **Using the Toolkit**

**Step 1: Exporting from Canvas**
> "Wait, where's Settings in Canvas? Oh, here... 'Export Course Content'... okay, clicking... it says 'preparing'... how long does this take? Oh good, I got an email! Downloaded!"

**Step 2: In the Toolkit**
> "Okay, Select .imscc File... found it! Auto-Fix... it's doing something! Wow, it says 'Fixed 47 issues automatically' - that's amazing! Now 'Guided Review'... oh, it's asking me about images. I can do this!"

**Step 3: Uploading Back**
> "It says create a NEW EMPTY test course... okay, I'll make one called 'Test ADA Course'... importing... IT WORKED! Oh my gosh, this actually worked!"

**✅ What Works:**
- Auto-fix is like magic to her
- Guided review walks her through one image at a time
- Activity log shows what it did (she feels in control)
- Not overwhelming

**❌ Challenges:**
- Didn't understand that she should test first before using live course
- Almost uploaded directly to her real course
- Would have benefited from bigger warning about testing

**Sentiment:**
> "I can't believe this is free! This would have taken me WEEKS. I'm telling everyone in my school about this tomorrow. Where's the share button? Found it! Copying this to our teacher Slack right now."

**Net Promoter Score:** 10/10 (Extreme Promoter)

## PERSONA 2: Marcus Thompson - High School Math Teacher

### Demographics
- **Age**: 45
- **Location**: Chicago, IL
- **Experience**: 18 years teaching
- **Tech Level**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate - comfortable with Office, Canvas, basic tech)
- **Subject**: Algebra II & Calculus
- **School Type**: Urban Public High School

### Background
Marcus has tons of math content with equations rendered as images (before he learned about LaTeX). He knows about the ADA deadline and has been procrastinating because it feels overwhelming. His courses have 10+ years of accumulated content. He's skeptical of "automated" tools because he's been burned before by software that promises miracles.

### Goals
- Convert his equation images to accessible LaTeX
- Fix everything efficiently (he's coaching basketball, limited time)
- Verify that the tool doesn't break his carefully organized course structure
- Learn best practices for future content

---

### 📊 MARCUS'S EVALUATION

#### **Landing Page**

**First Impression:**
> "Hmm, 'automatically remediates'... sounds too good to be true. But it says it's open-source, so I can check the code. Built with AI from Google DeepMind? Interesting. Let me download and test it."

**✅ What Works:**
- Open-source = trustworthy
- GitHub link lets him verify code
- "Works for K-12 & Higher Ed" - comprehensive
- Technical enough to be credible

**❌ Skepticism:**
- No technical details on HOW it works
- No benchmarks (accuracy rates, success metrics)
- Missing: "Used by X schools/teachers"
- Wants to see limitations upfront

**What He Needs:**
- Technical documentation link
- "How it works" section with methodology
- Accuracy rates for common fixes
- Known limitations section

---

#### **Using the Toolkit**

**First Test:**
> "Okay, I'm going to test this on my Algebra II Unit 1 first. If it works, then I'll do the rest. Creating a test course... exporting... importing to toolkit..."

**Auto-Fix Results:**
> "It fixed 89 issues? Let me check what it did... *reads activity log* ...okay, it made all my headings proper H2s and H3s. That's correct. Color contrast fixes look good. Tables now have proper headers. This is actually solid work."

**Math Equations Challenge:**
> "Ugh, I have 50+ equation images. Do I really need to type LaTeX for all of these? Wait, what's this 'Magic Wand' button? Oh, it's asking for an API key... and it says PAID. Nope, not spending money on this. I'll just type them manually."

**✅ What Works:**
- Activity log gives him confidence (he can verify changes)
- Doesn't break his course structure
- Batch processing is efficient
- Quality of fixes is high

**❌ Frustrations:**
- Paid AI feature felt like a bait-and-switch
- No free OCR option for math (even basic)
- Wished for LaTeX templates for common equations
- No "undo" button (makes him nervous)

**After Testing:**
> "Okay, this actually saved me about 20 hours of work. The core tool is solid. I'm going to use it for all my courses. But I'm not thrilled about the paid AI thing - feels like a premium feature hidden in a 'free' tool. Still, 95% of what I need is free, so I'll take it."

**Net Promoter Score:** 7/10 (Passive - would recommend with caveats)

**What Would Make Him a Promoter:**
- Free basic math OCR (even if less accurate)
- Technical docs on the algorithms
- Success metrics/benchmarks
- Clearer messaging: "Advanced AI features optional, paid"

### Background
Jennifer teaches online and hybrid ESL courses to diverse students, many with accessibility needs. She's bilingual and works with students who use screen readers. She's passionate about accessibility but doesn't have formal training in it. She's juggling 5 sections (120 students total) and limited support staff.

### Goals
- Ensure content is accessible for ESL students with disabilities
- Add proper alt text that's helpful for language learners
- Learn accessibility best practices
- Meet the deadline without compromising quality

---

### 📊 JENNIFER'S EVALUATION

#### **Landing Page**

**First Impression:**
> "Community colleges! Yes! And it mentions elementary through university - nice to see us included. The mission statement resonates - I do want to make online spaces helpful for ALL students."

**✅ What Works:**
- Inclusive language (K-12 through university)
- Free and open-source (budget constraints are real)
- Mission-driven (not just compliance-focused)
- Professional appearance

**❌ Missing:**
- No mention of multilingual considerations
- Accessibility of the tool itself (is it accessible?)
- Nothing about serving diverse/ELL populations

---

#### **First-Time User Experience**

**Opens wizard:**
> "Great, step-by-step guide. But I wish there was something specific about best practices for alt text. My students are learning English - should alt text be simple or detailed?"

**✅ What Works:**
- Clear workflow
- Non-intimidating
- Emphasis on testing first

**❌ Gaps:**
- No guidance on alt text for language learners
- No examples of good vs. bad alt text
- Missing: "Best practices for ESL/diverse learners"

---

#### **Guided Review Process**

**Reviewing images:**
> "Okay, it's asking me to describe this image of 'irregular verbs chart'. AI suggestion says 'Chart showing irregular verb conjugations'. That works! But for this cultural image... the AI said 'People celebrating' - that's too generic. My students need context: 'Students celebrating Dia de los Muertos with traditional face painting and marigolds.'"

**✅ What Works:**
- One-by-one review lets her add context
- AI suggestions give her a starting point
- She can customize for her audience
- Shows surrounding text for context

**❌ Limitations:**
- AI doesn't understand pedagogical context
- No guidance on describing cultural images
- No saved templates or saved descriptions she could reuse
- Can't batch-edit similar images

**Feature Requests:**
- "Common Patterns" - save frequently used descriptions
- Alt text library for ESL educators
- Examples: "Describing cultural images for ELL students"
- Batch apply saved descriptions

---

**After Completing One Course:**
> "This saved me SO much time. My alt text is better than it would have been if I rushed through manually. I love that I can customize every description. The auto-fixes for headings and contrast were perfect. I'm confident my students with screen readers will have a much better experience."

**Sharing Feedback:**
> "I'm going to recommend this at our next department meeting. We have 12 ESL instructors and everyone is stressed about the deadline. This will help. I do wish there was more guidance on accessible content for language learners specifically."

**Net Promoter Score:** 9/10 (Strong Promoter)

**Why Not 10?**
- Missing ESL/multilingual considerations
- No alt text library or templates
- Would love community features (share best practices)

---

## PERSONA 4: Dr. Robert Kim - University Chemistry Professor

### Demographics
- **Age**: 52
- **Location**: Boston, MA
- **Experience**: 25 years teaching, 15 years online
- **Tech Level**: ⭐⭐ (Low - has grad assistant handle most tech)
- **Subject**: Organic Chemistry
- **School Type**: Private Research University

### Background
Dr. Kim has extensive course content with complex chemical diagrams, lab procedures, and scientific notation. He's been teaching the same way for years and is frustrated by the ADA mandate ("more bureaucracy"). His IT department told him to "fix everything by April" but provided no resources. He's considering hiring a consultant but the quotes are $5,000+.

### Goals
- Comply with university mandate (avoid trouble)
- Spend as little time as possible on this
- Not break his existing content
- Delegate to his TA if possible

---

### 📊 DR. KIM'S EVALUATION

#### **Landing Page**

**First Impression:**
> "Free? That's better than $5,000. But is it going to work for university-level science content? Looks like it was made for K-12... 'elementary to university' okay, but will it handle chemical structures?"

**✅ What Works:**
- Free (saves the department budget)
- Quick - "minutes not months"
- Professional looking
- University is mentioned

**❌ Concerns:**
- Skeptical it can handle complex technical content
- No mention of scientific diagrams
- Worried about chemistry notation
- No case studies from universities

**What He Needs:**
- "Works with complex scientific content"
- University chemistry professor testimonial
- "Handles LaTeX, chemical formulas, diagrams"

---

#### **Delegation Attempt**

**Sends to his TA:**
> "Here, fix my courses with this tool. Due Friday."

**TA's Experience:**
> "This is actually pretty straightforward, but I need Dr. Kim to write alt text for the chemical diagrams - I don't understand the chemistry well enough. The auto-fix worked great for formatting. But the AI alt text generator doesn't understand ChemDraw structures."

**Dr. Kim's Response:**
> "Fine, I'll write descriptions for the 30 main diagrams. You do the rest."

---

#### **Using It Himself (Reluctantly)**

**After TA does initial processing:**
> "Okay, this isn't as painful as I thought. I click through the images, type what the molecule is, done. The tool already fixed all the heading and table stuff - that would have been tedious. Actually... this is kind of satisfying seeing all the fixes."

**Surprise Benefit:**
> "Wait, it flagged that my red text on blue background has low contrast? I never thought about that. And tables need captions? This is actually making me think about my students with disabilities more than I was before."

---

**Final Assessment:**
> "I'm impressed. This saved me probably $5,000 and several weeks. More importantly, it educated me on why accessibility matters. The auto-fixes are solid for academic content. The only issue was chemical structures - the AI couldn't handle those, but that's understandable. Everything else worked perfectly."

**Net Promoter Score:** 8/10 (Promoter)

**Why He's Promoting It:**
- Saved department $5,000
- Way faster than expected
- Actually educational (learned about accessibility)
- Will recommend to colleagues in faculty meeting

**What Would Make It 10/10:**
- Support for scientific notation/diagrams
- University case studies
- Ability to import/export alt text libraries (for TAs)

---

#### **Scalability Testing**

**Questions:**
1. Can I deploy this to 2,000 teachers? 
   - ⚠️ Would need deployment script (manual download not scalable)
   
2. Can I track who's completed compliance?
   - ❌ No tracking/reporting feature
   
3. Can I centralize API keys (if district purchases)?
   - ❌ Each teacher needs individual key
   
4. Can I provide support at scale?
   - ⚠️ Would need to create support documentation

5. Can I generate district-wide compliance reports?
   - ❌ No district dashboard

---

#### **Pilot Program Design**

**Keisha's Plan:**
> "I'm going to pilot this with 50 teachers (5 from each level). If it works, I'll do a district-wide rollout. I'll need to create supplementary training materials and a support workflow."

**Pilot Results (30 days):**
- 48/50 teachers successfully used it
- Average time saved per teacher: 15 hours
- Total cost: $0 (vs. $50K commercial option)
- Teacher satisfaction: 92% positive feedback
- Compliance rate: 95% (up from 12%)

---

**Recommendation to Superintendent:**

> - Allocate 1 IT staff for troubleshooting
> 
> **Total Implementation Cost:** ~$15K (staff time)
> **Savings vs. Commercial:** $35-85K
> 
> **ROI:** District compliance + massive cost savings"

---

**Net Promoter Score:** 9/10 (Strong Promoter)

**Why She's Promoting It:**
- Will recommend to other district IDs at state conference
- Planning to present case study at EdTech conference
- Drafting testimonial for developer
- Connecting developer with other districts

**Why Not 10/10:**
