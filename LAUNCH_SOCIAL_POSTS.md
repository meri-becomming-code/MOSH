# 📣 MOSH ADA Toolkit: Social Media Launch Assets

## 💼 LinkedIn Version (Professional / Educator-to-Educator)
**Headline: Reclaiming 6+ Hours/Week with the MOSH ADA Toolkit**

Accessibility is a human right, but for many of us in higher ed, remediation has become an overwhelming "second job" of unpaid labor. 🎓

I’m thrilled (and humbled) to share the **MOSH ADA Toolkit**—a project born in my own classroom to solve my own struggle. Named after my son, Michael Joshua, whose journey through blindness reminds me daily that accessibility is a lifeline, not just a requirement.

This tool is a **Gift**. No subscriptions, no fees. Just a way to help you:
✅ **"Roll the Dice"**: Batch convert entire directories of Word, PPT, and PDF into clean HTML.
✅ **Auto-Fix**: Instantly correct heading hierarchies and table structures.
✅ **Track Your Time**: See exactly how many hours of manual labor you've reclaimed.

**A Gift for my Fellow Teachers... 🎁**

Lately, I've been working on something very close to my heart. We all know how important it is to make our classes accessible, but the hours spent fixing files can feel like a mountain we’re climbing alone. 

I’m releasing the **MOSH ADA Toolkit** today—named for my son, Mosh. This tool was revealed to me one insight at a time while I was trying to solve these problems for my own students. I believe this ability was a gift from God, and as a Christian, it is my joy to share it with you freely. 🕊️

If you’re a teacher struggling with Canvas files, PDFs, or accessibility checklists: Use this. Share it. Take your weekends back. You focus on the students; let MOSH handle the code.
