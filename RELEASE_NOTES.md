# MOSH ADA Toolkit - Release Notes

## Latest Updates (February 6, 2026)

## 🚀 New Features
- **✨ Full Automation**: The toolkit now **automatically** removes all red `[ADA FIX]` labels and `[FIX_ME]` tags at the end of the Auto-Fix and Batch conversion processes. No manual cleanup button required!
- **📸 Smart Image Alignment**: 
    - **Word & PDF**: Images now retain their natural sizing and positioning using CSS floats.
    - **PowerPoint**: Enhanced alignment detection (left, right, or center) ensuring lecture notes follow the original slide layout.
- **🛠️ Table Structure Sanitizer**: Automatically fixes "Invalid Table Structure" errors in Canvas by cleaning up out-of-order tags and empty content.
- **🧠 Jeanie Magic (AI-LaTeX Conversion)**: Integrated Gemini AI to automatically generate LaTeX code from math equations in images. Just add your free API key in settings and type `MAGIC` during guided review.
- **🔄 Sync-on-Convert**: Individual conversion buttons (Word, PPT, PDF) now automatically synchronize with the `imsmanifest.xml` for seamless Canvas imports.

### 🎯 PDF to HTML Conversion - Major Improvements

**Problem Solved:** PDF conversions were creating fragmented output with each text span becoming a separate paragraph, making content difficult to read and causing accessibility issues.

**What's Fixed:**
- **Text Aggregation**: Text spans are now combined into complete lines before processing
- **Smart Paragraph Grouping**: Related lines are grouped into coherent paragraphs using vertical spacing analysis
- **Bullet List Detection**: Bullet points (•, -, *, ◦, ▪, ⚬) are now properly detected and formatted as `<ul>` and `<li>` tags
- **Priority Logic**: List detection takes priority over font-based header detection to prevent bullets from being misclassified as headers

**Impact:**
- ✅ Screen readers can now properly announce list structures
- ✅ Content flows naturally with proper paragraph breaks
- ✅ Document semantic structure is preserved
- ✅ No more fragmented text with dozens of tiny paragraphs

**Technical Details:**
- Modified `converter_utils.py` lines 655-738
- Three-stage processing: span aggregation → line grouping → semantic unit detection
- Vertical spacing threshold of 24px determines paragraph breaks
- Supports both bulleted and numbered list patterns

### 🖼️ PowerPoint Image Sizing Fix

**Problem Solved:** Images from PowerPoint files were being converted too large, dominating the page width.

**What's Fixed:**
- Images are now limited to 50% of page width when text content is present
- Better image-to-text ratio for improved readability
- Maintains visual balance in converted content

### 💬 "Spread the Word" Message Update

**What's Changed:**
- Updated the post-conversion message with current information
- Encourages users to share the toolkit with colleagues
- Helps build the alpha testing community

---

## How to Use These Improvements

### PDF Conversion
Simply convert any PDF file using:
- **Single file**: Click the PDF button and select a file
- **Batch conversion**: Use "Roll the Dice" to process entire folders
- **Canvas import**: Import `.imscc` files - PDFs are automatically processed

All three methods use the same improved conversion engine.

### Verification
To verify the improvements:
1. Convert a PDF with lists or paragraphs
2. Open the generated HTML file
3. Look for `<ul>` and `<li>` tags (lists)
4. Check that paragraphs contain complete thoughts, not single lines
